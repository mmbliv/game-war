# GAME-WAR
## About The Game
 The goal is to be the first player to win all 52 cards.
 ### The  Deal
 - The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving the same amount of cards.
### The Play
- Each player give out one card for each round, and the player with the highest card takes all the cards and put them on the bottom of its stack.
- If there are more than one players who have the highest card, it is War. Those players will give out another three cards out, and compare the one on the top of those extra three cards.
